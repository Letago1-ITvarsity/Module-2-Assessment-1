                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
                            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or simply panda) is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.</p>
                            <p>Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 10–15 cm (4–6 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder. </p>
                            <p>Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb).[38] Females (generally 10–20% smaller than males)[39] can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb).</p>
